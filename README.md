# TrainingParnter
Learning ground for Eirik, creating a training scheduler including various information to make i work. 

## Basic functionalitation
Have a list of workouts that I normaly use with category, duration, etc. Dragg n dropp into a week/month to creata a schedule. Perhaps align that with Joe Friels Training bilbl to verify taht the chosen workouts fullfill the week goal.

Also information from personal and work calendar should identify any overlaps. Perhaps even amount of daylight and weather to avoid long bike sessions in the rain when its dark

In the future perhaps expand into ml/ai to suggest workout based on desired outcome or identufyed race from calendar

## Techlology 
is not yet chosen but perhaps I will try different approches here. both internal tools from Equinor and available tools outside my workplace
